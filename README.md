# Cardano Constitution Working Group

## Repo Info

This repository will house the data from both surveys of the Cardano Consititution working group.

> Please note the raw data will be available in the future.

## Background

The Cardano Constitution Working Group was created as part of the Gimbalabs Tokenomics PBL. While the intitial participation was relatively high, over time the participation level drastically dropped. The Constitution WG lives on here in this repository (mainly this page). The acutal [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/767416282198835220/958407168174985306) is still live for now and is part of Allocation Zero (A0) of the aforementioned Tokenomics PBL group.

I would like to thank all those who were initial participants of this group with a special shout out to **Sym**. There are other Cardano community members who helped in the creation of and distribution of the NFT incentives for survey no. 2 and helped scope down responses from survey no. 1. To these members, we greatly appreciate your assitance and input.

To the community, a sincere thank you to those who have participated in the surveys. Without you there would be no survey data, nothing to share, fewer data points and far fewer voices heard (and viewed).

## Survey Links and Information

The surveys below attempted to remove as much team bias as possible from the instructions, verbiage and pre-populated data.

> While the CCWG did receive a distribution of Gimbal tokens none of the team members received individual distributions of Gimbals (GMBL) for this work. Artists were compensated in ADA or decided to apply royalties on their NFTs.
